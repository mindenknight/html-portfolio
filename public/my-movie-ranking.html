<h1>The Best Movies According to Justin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man</h3>
<p>
    This is one of the best movies ever and kicks off the trilogy with Tobey Maguire.<br />
    I watched this movie non-stop as a kid.
</p>
<h3>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2</h3>
<p>
    It's a sequel that is absolutely amazing! Doc Ock never looked better than in this movie.<br />
    Also, the epic Spider-Man 2 video game exists because of this movie!
</p>
<h3>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3</h3>
<p>
    Continues the amazing story of the first 2 while throwing everything but the kitchen sink at Spider-Man.<br />
    Bonus points as the most memeable of the trilogy and because Bully Maguire
